I first became interested in western water management during a summer spent working for as a hydrology intern for Ashley National Forest in Vernal, Utah. Having previously lived only on the shores of the Great Lakes, assessing streamflows and riparian health in semi-arid Vernal opened my eyes to the unique challenges of managing water supplies in a scarce environment. Following this experience, I pursued independent research analyzing water rights systems across the West. After graduating from Northwestern University with a B.S. in Environmental Engineering, I spent 4 years working as a project manager for ECS Midwest in Chicago, Illinois, primarily focused on site characterization and remediation. 

I am currently a second-year masterâ€™s student and Sustainable Water Markets Fellow at the Bren School at UC Santa Barbara, specializing in both Water Resources Management and Economics and Politics of the Environment. I am passionate about applying my skills and training to improve water management in order to better meet the needs of communities and the environment.
